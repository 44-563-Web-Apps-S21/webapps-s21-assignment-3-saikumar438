    <h4>The BlackSnake</h4>
    
    <h5>Superpowers</h5>
    <p>
        Black Snakes behavioral characteristics, such as their speed and agility, the bifid tongue, unblinking lidless eyes, their ability to periodically renew their skin, <br>
        their mode of mating, and the ability to produce and inject a deadly substance 
        and it's as common for people to be bitten around the home as it is out in the bush or other wild areas<br>
        These snakes live largely solitary lives, hidden away waiting to ambush their next meal. It can be a long wait.<br>
         If necessary, they can go for two years without feeding, but when a chance arises they are among the deadliest and most efficient carnivores on the planet. <br>
         And like all snakes, their first weapon is not size or strength, but sheer speed.
