            <h6> Playing Cricket</h6>
            <p>I like cricket because it is a <Strong>Team game</Strong>.
                 The reason why I like cricket most is mainly the <b>rules</b> of the game
                  which are much more interesting than any other game in the world.<br>
                   As a cricket player I can do anything like batting,bowling,wicketkeeping and fielding
                    but the enjoyment of hitting the ball with bat is a very sweet movement for a batsman.
